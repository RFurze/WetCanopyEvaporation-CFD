The Cases in this folder are as follows:

buoyantBoussinesqPimple: 
This case is a default version of the buoyantBoussinesqSimple example for flow through a canopy, but adapted to be transient using the PIMPLE solver.

buoyantBoussinesqPIMPLES-ScalarTransport: 
Adapted version of the above, with an additional scalar s being transported. The solver has not been adapted.


buoyantBoussinesqSimple-Scalar-LADSource: 
Uses buoyantBoussinesqSimpleFoamV2, a solver with added scalar transport, generated where the LAD <> 0.

buoyantBoussinesqSimple-Scalar-LADSource-V2: 
uses same solver as above

buoyantBoussinesqSimple-ScalarTransport: Uses the same solver as above, but uses the ground as the scalar source
